    <p>My name is Caitlin, and if there is one thing I’m passionate about, it’s food. Whether it’s going to the grocery store or farmer’s market and picking out fresh ingredients for a recipe you’ve never tried or it’s visiting a hole-in-the-wall restaurant, from how it’s grown to how it’s prepared – I <i>love</i> me some food. A huge driving factor in me starting this blog. Any-who, I am a Senior at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro (major is a secret though until I get my diploma). I love to write and take photos.</p>

    <p>I figured this would be a great way to creatively integrate all my passions and share them with you all with hopes that you’d find enjoyment in what I post and also maybe even help you plan a date night out with great food and good fun, or maybe you’re just having a night out with friends. It is my sincere hope that this will be the place you come to find inspiration on where you should go and what you should do when enjoying your night out with the people you love the most.</p>

    <p>With that being said, let's dig in!</p>
